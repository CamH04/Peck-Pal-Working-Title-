# Title: Peck Pal (Working Title)

## Genre: Idle Clicker / Desktop Companion

## Platform: Windows, Linux

## Engine: SFML

An animated bird perches on your desktop and pecks downward every time you type or click. Each input triggers an animation and counts toward unlocking cosmetic items and upgrades. The bird will have idle animations and will chirp if you click on it. Very much like [Bongo Cat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/Bongo_Cat/) but with birds.
